The Omer, the barley offering brought on the 16th of Nissan, released the new crop for eating if a defect occurred, they wouldn't be able to bring the offering on that day and the new crop would have remained forbidden for the entire year!\nb. If there was a defect in the Two Loaves brought on Shavuos, we would have been unable to bring this offering, and would then have been unable to use the new wheat crop for minchah on the mizbe'ach.\nc. If a defect were found on the 12 loaves of the Lechem HaPanim that were baked before Shabbos, no new loaves would have been able to be set on the Shulchan until the following week.`,

Rebbi Yehudah ben Beseira advised him that, if he really wanted the best part of the Korban, then the following year, he should ask for the fat-tail of the lamb. Every Jew knew that the fat-tail of the lamb of any Korban went on the Mizbe'ach, and was not distributed. Consequently, when, on the following year, the gentile asked for the fat-tail, he aroused their suspicion, which resulted in an investigation. When they discovered his true identity, they killed him.
